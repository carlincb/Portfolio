# Portfolio

## Description

- What was my motivation? I needed a Portfolio to display my coding knowledge.
- Why did I build this project? I built this project to better understand the logic behind Responsive Design, as well as how to use CSS to style a page, and finally to create a place to display my current and future projects.
- What problem does it solve? This Portfolio provides a place for employers to view my work.
- What did I learn? I learned about Responsive Design and CSS properties

## Installation

Although this is simply a webpage displaying my Portfolio and no installation is necessary, there were certain criteria that had to be met in order to complete this project:

    User Story
    AS AN employer
    I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
    SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

    Acceptance Criteria
    Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:
    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
