            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Colleen Fimister. I am an experienced educator, adminstrator, and manager, but the world of engineering has always called to me. 
                As such, I am now embarking on an exciting new stage in my life: Software Engineering. I hope to expand my skills in this area by attending the University of Denver's Full Stack Flex Program: Coding Bootcamp.
                I have been fascinated by Mathematics and Engineering since Middle School. I have always had a variety of interests and I hope this would make me an asset to a wide variety of teams. 
                I have strong Communication and Managerial skills, along with my Mathematical and Coding skills. This has taken me anywhere from Director of Kumon Mathematics to founding my own Hybrid School. 
                I have tutored Mathematics, History, and  English, as well as directed a tutoring company of over 120 tutors. I am thrilled to be able to apply my knowledge of Management, Customer Relations, Training, and Mathematics, to this new field. 
                I am highly organized and prioritize good communication and customer care within any team or client base. I look forward to working with you!
